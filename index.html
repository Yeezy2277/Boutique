							Definitions <br/> <br/>
								A prototype in our case is a technical application of a service: for a mobile or a website.
							In the MVP process (Minimum Viable Product) we check: <br/>
								- Does anyone need it? And who exactly needs it? <br/>
								- Are people willing to pay for this product / service?<br/>
								- Is the Customer Acquisition Cost fit our financial model?<br/>
							The most important part of an MVP is the marketing funnel test. The MVP is actually a process in which 
							we choose which messages, channels and destinations, we want to focus on, when we reach out to our customers.
							in order to answer ourselves for that questions we should take into consideration what mentioned 
							in section 2 above.
							The site itself or the mobile app is just the landing page at the end of the funnel, where we calculate 
							the target operation, such as clicking the 'Buy' button. This calculation is necessary in order to calculate 
							the purchase cost.
							In the simplest case, this is done by dividing the number of clicks on the button by the amount of money 
							invested in publishing the messages, channels and destinations.
							To count the number of clicks on the `Buy` button, you do not even need a finished product / service. 
							In response to a click on a button, there is no need to even display a window with a message such as: 
							'Your response is very important to us, keep in touch, we will contact you when our product is ready.'
							6.At this point we understand that in many cases, a finished prototype is not required for MVP. we can 
							get along with a simple landing page that convinces the customer to purchase and a 'buy' button for example.
							Warnings
							1. Never say that you did an MVP if you did a survey such as: 'Would you use such a product if 
							I will make one?''. A response to the product will appear only as soon as the first person will click 
							the 'Buy' button through your funnel. Until then, for the sake of simplicity, assume that people lie in polls.
							2. Never call a single landing page that you made: an MVP. The MVP is not a single landing page that you only 
							show to your friends and acquaintances.
							Without marketing funnel test that include enough target audience that respond to you, you actually 
							do not perform an MVP and you will only come to the wrong conclusions.
							</p>

							<p class="articles-slider__text">
							Conclusions <br/><br/>
	
							It's better to start with an MVP than with a prototype, it will save time and money.
							In 90% of cases, already at the MVP stage you will understand what is needed for development and what is not.
							Do not ask money from investors in order to finish the prototype, first get real results for the research you did in MVP.
							If you are unable to perform an MVP without being funded by investors, you probably do not have enough capabilities to 
							perform MVP on your own.
							4.If you are thinking that your main goal is to build a prototype first and then to let the professionals get 
							the funding from investors for marketing and sales - this is a serious mistake.
							There is no point in trying to raise money from investors before you made an MVP.
							If you do not know where and how to look for potential customers or you are first thinking of building a 
							prototype that will help you present yourself for the purpose of raising money from investors, do not butter!
							 do not start building the prototype at all! and if you started with it, then stop, and it is recommended to 
							 read this entire post from the beginning and internalize it.
